# Postman JSON Documentation

**Created on:** 2025-07-25 at 13:49  
 **Purpose:** This document provides a reference Postman JSON object to assist support and development teams during API integration and testing.

## üîç Why this documentation?

This documentation was created as a temporary support tool **until Swagger (OpenAPI)** is fully integrated into the project. It serves as a bridge for:

- QA and support teams to understand and test API endpoints.
- Developers to debug and verify request/response formats.
- Ensuring consistent communication while Swagger is being set up.

##  What's inside?

- A ready-to-import Postman collection in JSON format.
- Example request bodies, headers, and expected responses.
- Notes for common edge cases or usage patterns.
